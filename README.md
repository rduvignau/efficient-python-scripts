# Efficient Python Scripts Tutorial

This tutorial, developed as part of the DAT300 / DIT615 Data-driven support for cyber-physical systems, aims to give some simple and useful tips on how to improve the performance of your Python scripts. Python is now ubiquitous in many domains such as machine learning, embedded devices, scientific computing and networking. To follow the tutorial, you are expected to be at least "conversational" in Python that is to understand its syntax and having already programmed at least once in it. Let's note that the tutorial focuses on Python but many of the below tips are regardless applicable to other scripting languages.
