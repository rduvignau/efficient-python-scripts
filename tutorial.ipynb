    "<h1>Efficient Python Scripts Tutorial</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Romaric Duvignau, duvignau@chalmers.se, license MIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial, developed as part of the <a href=\"http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2017/course/DAT300/\">DAT300 / DIT615 Data-driven support for cyber-physical systems</a>, aims to give some simple and useful tips on how to improve the performance of your Python scripts. Python is now ubiquitous in many domains such as machine learning, embedded devices, scientific computing and networking. To follow the tutorial, you are expected to be at least \"conversational\" in Python that is to understand its syntax and having already programmed at least once in it. Let's note that the tutorial focuses on Python but many of the below tips are regardless applicable to other scripting languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>About Python</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm language that offers ease to program, ease to read source-code even when not knowing the language and comes with an intuitive networking library.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never used it, it might be worth to follow a basic tutorial beforehand, for example check the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/\">getting started page</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>About the tutorial</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a <a href=\"https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html\">working jupyter notebook</a> to run the tutorial and if you are reading those lines it should be the case. The tutorial mostly builds on Python standard library with the exception of *matplotlib* for the plots and *numpy* used in **Part 2**. If you have a fresh Python install, you'll need to install those, the simplest is by running:  \n",
    "```pip install matplotlib numpy```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the tutorial is to get a feeling of places where easy optimization is possible when writing your scripts. It was not meant as, but it can actually also be used as a quick reference guide for many Python syntax elements as the small pieces of code deal with various Python aspects. At last the tutorial itself can also be a simple starting tool for using jupyter and is written for a complete beginner in jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercises are more guided on purpose and the later ones are intended to be mainly explored on your own. The main purpose of the tutorial, beyond giving you some useful tips and tricks to make your scripts more powerful, is to also provide a guide of good habits when considering different implementation to choose from: **testing!**\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Disclaimer** We are still experiencing with such a tutorial and improving it over the years, so ideas to complement it and feedback are more than welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Jupyter shortcuts (for complete beginners to get started)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Single click* to **select** a cell (click on the left margin of the cell so to use of the keyboard shortcuts)\n",
    "- Once a cell is selected, press *a* = to add a new cell **Above**, and *b* = add a new cell **Below**\n",
    "- *Double click* to **edit** a cell\n",
    "- *Ctrl + Enter* to **run** (ie execute) a selected cell\n",
    "- *m* = turn the selected a cell into a **Markup** cell, *y* = to turn a selcted cell into a **Code** cell\n",
    "- As usual, use *TAB* to autocomplete your code\n",
    "- *Shift + TAB* to display a *function definition* (quick acces to the documentation)\n",
    "- toggle block comment: *Ctrl + /* (use numpad one on swedish keyboard)\n",

    "## Example (A): Popping an element from a list\n",
    "\n",
    "This example can serve as the archetypal case where the wrong choice of data structure has a very significant impact. Basically, after observing that appending and popping an element from the end of a Python list (as with a stack data structure) are amortized constant time operation, you wrongly assumed popping from the beginning of the list would be an operation enjoying a similar cost. This is not the case!\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice first that removing an element from a list is at least as costly as popping an element as you can write the latter using the former: `del L[0]` in lieu of `L.pop(0)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually a simple trick consist to build and update the list in the opposite direction so that popping will be a constant-time operation. In general, the appropriate data structure to use when popping can come from both sides is called `deque` from the `collections` library. \n",

    "## Example (b): Storing elements with a list (or matrix) or a dictionary (aka hashmap)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have another example playing with the data structure's complexity, slightly more involved this time. Let's consider the following very common scenario: you have multi-dimensional data that you must organize and you are hesitating between using a matrix based on lists or a Python dictionary. Let's assume for example you have 2D datapoints $(x,y)$ such $1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$ and each is associated with a certain value. An operation that you will often have to do is for example to sum all the values and you are wondering which data structure is better to store the datapoints (it is assumed here that datapoints have also often to be modified so we don't want a structure dedicated to calculate the sum, such as simply the list of values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a typical example where the answer is not binary. Using a dictionary might seem the best option as only values stored are accessed, but consider that going through all values is more costly than looping through an equivalent size list.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Part 2 -- Remember to stream your DATA\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes a well-designed mechanism to stream data called generators. Using generators allows to alleviate the use of allocating a structure to hold data if not needed; for example, almost all Python built-in functions (min/max, sum, iteration functions etc) use iterators by default avoiding in many situations the need of storing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a simple example to visualize how this can make your code more efficient. Streaming takes its full advantage when alleviating the allocation of huge memory space. Here is an example where we check how to retrieve the argmin from a certain list, in one example where we allocate the list in memory and in the second where we use streaming directly on the generator producing data. On top of being faster, the streaming implementation avoided the allocation of about ~10GB of memory (with `minsize=50_000_000`)."
